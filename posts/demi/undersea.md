<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/34/ac/5034acc923c35ae5e11a1aea1e21bc10.jpg">

A blue dragonborn captain garbed in a metal diving suit slides down the anchor chain from his ship above. Below through crystal clear water, a dim light blinks  from a sunken ship coated in coral and kelp. The surrounding reef's vibrant colors and bizzare creatures contrast the wooden wreck on the sea floor. The dragonborn's crew had already set up camp inside and have been searching every inch for the treasure stolen from the captain. The blinking singaled something important was found- this better be worth his time and not another wild goose chase else the signaller would never return to the surface. 

Beneath the waves is a magical world of mystery and majesty. Aquatic adventures tend to favor coves, caves, and ships while missing out on one of the greatest adventuring areas out there. Diverse environments, flora, fauna, and sunken objects create natural and magical areas that can inspire any character. Creatures of the deep are abundant in the Mosnter Manual. Their homes and tribal societies could populate the sea floor like the races of the land populate the Sword Coast. 

Underwater adventuring can be a challenge to start, but once players have reached a point where the the lack of oxygen and pressure is no longer an issue, deep dives beneath the waves can double the area avalible to explore. This domains and demigods looks to give DMs and players more tools to play with in the world under the sea. As they saying goes, "Everything's better, down where its wetter, under the sea!"
