      "snipit":"A blonde halfling darts around the corner, nimbly avoiding the sentry's notice. With a quick whisper to his fey patron, magical luck seeps out of him as an offering and in return fuels is magic. After a breif moment, the sentry yelps and leaps from his chair, darting towards the nearest bathroom. Gibby can feel his own luck being pressed, but he'll take anothers misfortune at the moment to progress towards the soon to be ill-gotten gains."

      "snipit":"A dwarf dawned in his own masterwork armor hides behind an iron statue of his ancestors- the monstrous demon thrashes about in the lava pools of their forge. He readies his axe, mutters a prayer, and turns the corner with a dwarfish battle cry. Orthos charges and leaps at the devil that triples him in size. Radiant flames lick the edge of his blade as it sinks into the chest of the Pit Fiend, splitting its scales and staining his armor in its fell blood."
