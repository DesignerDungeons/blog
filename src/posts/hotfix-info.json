      "snipit":"Gibby looks back at the Kalimor and Sigmond- surely the goblins will spot the impossible to hide wizard and paladin. Garbed in gaudy purple robes, the halfling warlock's eyes glow bright pink. He leaps out in front of the patrolling goblins. \"Hey! Hey! Over here!\" He shouts out, weaving words of luck under his breath while signaling for his allies to start running. He can feel his own luck start to fade as two more groups of goblins turn the corner and see him. Little do the goblins know, their luck has changed as well- as they pursue the distracting halfling, they can't seem to catch a break as they trip over themselves and fail to notice the elderly wizard and clunky, yet dashing, paladin escape with their treasures."

      "snipit":"By dim torchlight, Clarence leads his allies through the dank and decrepit mausoleum entrance. The light illuminates the backs of a group of patrolling zombies, each losing bits of themselves as they shamble. The light catches their attention- their heads swivel towards the paladin and his comrades. Dumb, dead stares lock eyes with the grinning chiseled-jaw human. Torch in one hand and blade in the other, blinding light erupts as Clarence cleaves his blade clean through the chests of the undead monsters. The zombies torsos slide off their legs, lifeless to the ground, dimly glowing where they radiance split them."
