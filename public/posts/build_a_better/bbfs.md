## Brew Bits: Fighting Styles 

The ambusher fantasy is a frequent request I get from players. A character who uses stealth and preparation to get the drop on their foes for their parties advantage. Goblin ambush leaders, elven scouts, and halfling assassin all are character types that fit within this fantasy. Without ample choices outside of rogue, how do we represent the "SUPRISE" playstyle? 

The options we're building today fit within this category: **fighting styles**. Fighting styles fundamnetally provide a core play pattern element to character builds. A fighter with Archery is encouraged to use a short bow while one with Protection wants a shield in their off hand as often as possible. Mechanically, the options are passive- the character doesn't consume any resources to use them, and they fundamentally improve the characters basic play style. 

Here are two itterations of the fighting style I would consider giving to a player looking to fulfil this character concept. The first fits in well with the existing options. The second instead pushes in the direction of Protection by working more as a team focused ability. 


>#### Fighting Style: Bushwacker
>
> Whenever you would select a fighting style from the ranger or fighter class, you may instead choose this fighting style.
>
> You gain a +2 bonus to initiative.
>
> Add a d6 to weapon attack and damage rolls made against creatures that have not acted in combat yet.



> #### Fighting Style: Ambush Leader
>
> Whenever you would select a fighting style from the ranger or fighter class, you may instead choose this fighting style.
>
>You gain a +2 bonus to initiative
>
> You and allied creatures within 5 feet of you deal an additional d6 damage with weapon attacks against creatures that have not acted in combat yet. 


### Flavor VS Function
Fighting styles focus primarily on function first to then encourage flavor. Take the Dueling fighting style, for example. Dueling says: 

> ##### Dueling 
>
> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

This doesn't explain the who are why behind the feature. It is a means of improving one-handed weapons in combat without rhyme or reason. This improvement shapes what a character with it looks like. A duelist might look to take advantage of a lone longsword or rapier. They can't be using a two-handed weapon or an off-hand weapon to gain this advantage. It shapes the flavor of the character by offering mechanical reward for weapon choice. 

When designing fighting styles, it is important to consider the comparitive weakness of a particular play pattern against other existing. Using Dueling again, we know that one-handed weapons tend to deal less damage than a player would otherwise do duel wielding or with a two-handed weapon. The mechanical boost then helps characters fulfil a fantasy of playing a sword and board fighter or a noble duelist while continuing to feel like they are doing fair amounts of damage compared to other existing builds. 

### Bounds
Fighting styles can quickly prove too powerful in some builds. Repeatable features that adjust a core play pattern need to be comaparatively reasonable with other existing options more so than infrequent resource abilities. A character that is seriously out peforming others consistently can lead to other players around the table feeling bad about their play pattern and damage. 

The existing fighting styles do an excellent job staying within the bounds of normal play patterns. A ranger with the Archery fighting style feels good about using their ranged weapon with a +2 bonus while the rest of the table likely doesn't feel oppressed by the extra 10% of die rolls that are now hits that weren't before. 

The best defining feature for bounds in my opinion is the Great Weapon Fighting style:

> ##### Great Weapon Fighting
>
>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

This encourages use of a high damage weapon. The mechanic gives players a mechanic that slightly increases the *average* damage of the already heavily damaging weapons without increasing the *maximum* damage. This key difference helps the option  feel powerful in a players hands. Switching a pair of 1s/2s to 5s/6s can feel amazing. What is important is that this damage still fits within the regular bounds the weapon would deal. Great swords can already deal 12 damage max and 2 min. This feature leaves those two core elements in tact while still providing a damage boosting mechanic to players.

### Building a Fighting Style
So how do we start building a fighting style?

#### Step 1: Target a Style of Fighting
It seems straight forward, but an actual difficult part of designing fighting styles is targeting an option that doesn't get what it wants from other fighting styles. Ranged characters and weapon specific characters tend to already be covered. 

What you could consider looking into would be classic looks like the net and trident gladiator. Creating a fighting style that supports using attacks for options other than damage, we suddenly have a huge amount of design space. 

Here is a starting idea table of fighting style possibilities and the weaknesses the option would look to overcome or additional strengths to build upon:

|Style|Weakness|Strength|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Tripper| Easy to get up, action consumptive|Set up allies, set up self|
|Reach| Two-handed, heavy, moderate damage| Attack of opportunity range, locking down an area|
|Versatile| Lower in damage, require open hand to switch|Flexibly switch between damaging modes and free hand| 
|Medium Ranged Weapons| Low damage, low range| Unique item, room to create|
|Ambusher| One moment of power, then fall off, initiative dependent| Get free attacks, early lead in the encounter|
