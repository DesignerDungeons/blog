### Level 6 Feature 
Here we have our first defensive feature. In our example, we use an unconventional tactic for defense: transparency. It does an excellent job of being a defensive tools Ooze-locks can employ when things are getting rough while also being a tool players can employ in creative ways to solve puzzles and navigate the world with. 

The fiend's level six feature is similar- it can be used on both saving throws AND ability checks, making it a defensive tool for when you fail a saving throw in the thick of things but also a feature that can bolster your chances at succeeding on any old ability check. The flexibility of the defensive feature is a great premise to design around. Making a feature players can use in ways outside the norm helps them feel awesome for figuring that out. Mist Escape is another great example- a warlock might prick themselves with a dagger to activate misty escape as just an invisible 60 ft. teleport outside of combat. 

This feature doesn't need to be defensive- if your first level feature encouraged defensive play, consider just adding a tool to the subclasses tool box players can mess around with in a variety of situations in and out of combat that alters the space they are working with. 

I’d recommend at least keeping the feature tied to a number of uses per rest or a feature that lets players take a new action or bonus action. Having more stuff to do at this level is needed when Warlocks are limited in spells per encounter by pact magic. 

The full Endless Ooze patron includes a greater diversity of 6th level features to choose from and will be coming out within a future project that’s currently a WIP. Try to always include diverse features that give players opportunities for customization and self-expression. 

### Level 10 Feature
At 10 warlocks tend to get a boring feature. Passive bonuses don't inherently feel epic, yet they bring a level of epic-ness to the character when effects that hinder the rest of the party fail to affect you. 

With this line of thought, I've presented the most basic iteration of the 10th level feature I'm happy with. What is important to every feature in the game is a sense of ownership. Here, players can pick from a variety of damage types to customize how their body has transformed. It takes on the normal effect of a 10th level feature while still feeling unique to the option. Ooze-locks have a greater constitution than other warlocks tend to have and a feature that supports having a higher Constitution. 

When building your own, consider how to make this passive feel unique and attached to your patron. Basic resistances and condition immunities are the easiest way to present the feature, but I'd seriously encourage digging into niche mechanics. Explore what you can do in the system- adding in dice rolling effects and dice manipulation is a great way to make a passive trait feel alive and unique to your option. 

### Level 14 Feature
Here is the coolest feature to design for your patron. This is your big flashy ability that best represents the patron and their warlocks- it is an awesome tool that players use to tie together the flavor of their subclass with the mechanics of their class. 

Our example shows a powerful feature tied to the most iconic of oozes. A player becoming a large amorphous blob that then devours a smaller creature just feels epic. It deals a fair chunk of damage but most importantly emphasizes the player fantasy that the player has been developing these past 14 levels. 

When building your own, you can build any variety of feature. Ours is similar to Hurl through Hell but modeling yours after Create Thrall can be an equally awesome ability. You can branch out into weirder design space here, too- this is the place for your awesome Warlock features that don’t fit anywhere else.

Anything that has a huge effect on the character that emphasizes the patron fantasy best should go here. By this level, most door ways are open as far as mechanics go- feel free to make a powerful feature to mess around with. You'd rather have a feature that is too strong here than too weak, and it’s okay to slowly real it in over time if it proves to be oppressing other players at the table.
