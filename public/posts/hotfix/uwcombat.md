Creative blurbs are hard to write man

Rules we are hotfixing: 

> ### Underwater Adventuring Rules
> The following rules apply when a character is under water
>#### Underwater Combat
>When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
>
>A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).
>
>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.
>
>#### Suffocating 
>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).
>
>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.
>
>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
>
>#### Swimming
>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

With so much to cover, lets *dive* right in with a variant change for underwater combat. Instead of the normal rules for underwater combat, consider using these simplified rules:

>#### Underwater Combat Hotfix: Rules Simplified  
>When making a weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed has disadvantage on the attack roll. A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range.
>
>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage. 
>

With these simplified rules, we've made it so players and DMs don't need to memorize a specific set list of weapons. But what about all those weapons that *should* shine under water? 

Instead of hiding a part of their niche within a tiny block of rules text, we can move it to each indivual weapon by adding a simple weapon property to all affected weapons: **aquatic!**

>#### New Weapon Property: Aquatic
> *Weapons with the aquatic property: daggers, javelins, shortswords, spears, tridents, crossbows, and nets.*
> 
> When making an attack with a weapon with this property under water, the wielder does not have disadvantage on the attack roll if they do not have a swim speed. 

Simple, clear, and to the point. This one weapon property explains the under water combat rules almost in its entirety. We additionally could reference the rules text for underwater combat here with a page marker to make it even easier for players and DMs to quickly find the rules on the fly. We condensed the amount a person has to read to understand the rules as well with only subtle adjustments to the actual mechanics. 

Our overall goal is to reduce confusion and frustration from handling underwater combat, and this clarification, while slightly hindering to thrown weapons other than daggers, javelins, spears, and tridents, it largely improves the simplicity of the game. 

On to our next troublesome mechanic: suffication! 

>#### Suffication Hotfix: Up the Ante
> A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).
>
>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.
> 
>Whenever a creature holding its breath takes damage for the first time each round, they must succeed on a Constitution saving  DC 10 or half the total damagae taken, whichever is higher. On a failed save, they have their remaining held breath time reduced by 5 rounds (30 seconds). 

This time, we've added complexity to a rule as opposed to reducing complexity. This change offers a more reasonable way to approach underwater combat and increase the danger from lacking oxygen. The core goal of this change is to create a larger difference between combat in and out of water with new ways to threaten even high level players. 

These suffication rules are for DMs who are looking for ways to challenge players outside of hit point damaging mechanics. They are only recommended for experienced DMs and players looking to increase the challenge level and variance of encounters in the world. In a scenario where you *are* a DM looking to up the ante, these rules can provide a much needed shakeup to bring more threat to encounters underwater. 

> #### Swimming Rules Hotfix: Learning to Swim/Climb
> >#### Swimming
>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
>
> A character proficient in the Athletics skill has a a climb speed and swim speed equal to their movement speed -5. 

This hotfix looks to bolster non-magical characters. By adding in a built in swim and climb speed to skills, character classes that naturally gravitate towards strength and dexterity now have more tools at their disposal to be the star of the show. Naturaly swim speeds and climb speeds offer classes that normally lack spells to aid in exploration could need a bit of love to have more say in how the adventure goes. 

This hotfix should work great at tables looking to give the martial classes a little more to do out of combat and close a bit of the gab between the two styles. I'd avoid it if a thief is present at the table, as the change lessens the power they get from their Second Story Work feature. 

### Concluding Thoughts
 
Here on Hotfix we aspire to bring new ways to play the game to a variety of tables. These rules should really *shore up* some troubling mechanics that can bring different problems to different tables. 

What do you think about these changes? Are any too ludicrous? Is any in particular so insignificant it should just be ignored? Let us know on Twitter @Designer Dungeons!
