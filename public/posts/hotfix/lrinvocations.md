## Hotfix: Spell Consuming Invocations 

Ladies and gentlmen, this just, this Hotfix article is looking at not one, not two, not even three, but SIX seperate abilities all at once. Is he mad? Can it be done? Can you address six unique features at once?

Well, to be fair, they are pretty similar. Today on Hotfix we're looking to address a category of Warlock invocations that don't get much love from the community: invocations that cast one spell using a spell slot per long rest.

Here are the seven invocations we'll be adjusting today: Thief of Five Fates, Mire the Mind, Bewitching Whispers, Dreadful Word,  Sculptor of Flesh, Sign of Ill Omen. Minion's of Chaos is deliberately abscent- as is, summoning magic with short rest spell slots is uniquely powerful compared to these other options.

These invocations all share one key flaw: they consume a Warlock spell slot to let a Warlock cast a spell outside of their core spell list. What is so wrong with these features that they need a change?

1. Comparatively underwhelming to the other existing invocations 
2. Tie up two different Warlock resources in one choice
3. Fail to expand on or improve a play pattern 

### Quick Fix
In order to address these invocations, we're going to be focusing on text all of them share. Here is their text box where the specific spell is replaced by *spell name*.

> #### Warlock Invocation
>
>You can cast *spell name* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>

Here are our three potential solutions 
#### Option 1: Quick Fix 
> #### Warlock Invocation
>You learn the *spell name* spell. You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

This fix power ups the option a lot. It both allows you to learn a spell otherwise outside the Warlock class and additionally gives you a free use once per long rest. Players that want to actively engage a spell like *slow* or *bane* into their character concept can do so with this change. Being able to use your regular slots to cast the invocation spell can help define an entire character build. 

In its current state, full on caster Warlocks that utilize a hefty spell list to act are not well supported. While they shouldn't compete toe to toe with Wizards and Sorcerers, having access to a specific spell one additional time goes a long way to supporting a desired play style. 

#### Option 2: Remove Concentration 
> #### Warlock Invocation 
> You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. If the spell requires concentration, it no longer requires concentration and lasts until no creatures are affected by it. 

By removing concentration on the spells and giving them a single free use per long rest, these invocations can act as encounter shaping effects. These invocations can now fit into many more builds than before as their concentration slot can still be used for spells like *hex*. 

This fix is the least powerful upgrade but changes the invocations in a meaningful way to give players more reasons to consider them. Any mechanic that breaks a core rule of the game tends to be powerful. Having an extra concentration slot, even when for a specific spell, is powerful. If the option still feels too weak at the table, however, consider adjusting it further from once per long rest to once per short. 

### Option 3: Give and Take 
Alright, this is a weird one- one of my weirder designs. This specific option would exclude Sculpter of Flesh and Sign of Ill Omen. Hear me out:
> #### Warlock Invocaiton
> You can casst *spell name* at will, without expending a spell slot. While at least one other creature is affected by the spell, you suffer the spells effect as well. Once no other creature is affect by the spell, the spell ends.

This option gives Warlock something they have been asking for since their conception: a way to sacrifice to make others suffer. The class fantasy of making a deal with the devil tends to be all upsides- here is a real, powerful feature that has a real, powerful downside. *Slow* at will can be powerful and build defining- but are you willing to also be slowed? Bestowing a curse on your enemies as a fey lock seems on point- but as a mortal wielding fey power, you too suffer from the misfortune *bane* brings. 

This change is the most volatile and potentially game breaking, but also the option I'd be most excited to pick up as a Warlock. Maybe some characters really only need on action on their turn- *slow* warlock builds could be a thing. Casting bane frequently to set up encounters can make a status effect focused Warlock for more engaging. 

This makes the invocations build defining similarly to Misty Visions and Fiendish Vigor. It would likely become a major part of the character's kit, and I think would shake up the table the most from being introduced.
