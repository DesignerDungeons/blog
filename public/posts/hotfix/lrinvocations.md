## Hotfix: Spell Consuming Invocations 

Ladies and gentlmen, this just, this Hotfix article is looking at not one, not two, not even three, but SIX seperate abilities all at once. Is he mad? Can it be done? Can you address six unique features at once?

Well, to be fair, they are pretty similar. Today on Hotfix we're looking to address a category of Warlock invocations that don't get much love from the community: invocations that cast one spell using a spell slot per long rest.

Here are the seven invocations we'll be adjusting today: Thief of Five Fates, Mire the Mind, Bewitching Whispers, Dreadful Word,  Sculptor of Flesh, Sign of Ill Omen. Minion's of Chaos is deliberately abscent- as is, summoning magic with short rest spell slots is uniquely powerful compared to these other options.

These invocations all share one key flaw: they consume a Warlock spell slot to let a Warlock cast a spell outside of their core spell list. What is so wrong with these features that they need a change?

1. Comparatively underwhelming to the other existing invocations 
2. Tie up two different Warlock resources in one choice
3. Lead to feast/famine or feels bad moments 

### Quick Fix
In order to address these invocations, we're going to be focusing on text all of them share. Here is their text box where the specific spell is replaced by *spell name*

Here are our three potential solutions
