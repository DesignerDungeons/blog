## Hotfix: Divine Smite

When playing the Paladin class, the question frequently comes up- do I smite? 

Useful tip for new players: yes. Yes you smite.

Divine Smite is a class feature that turns spellcasting into raw damage. Paladins more than any martial class have access to the largest toolbox and smite tends to push their damage to the top of the charts.

>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

In my personal expierences with how I run larger encounters, but fewer per long rest, I find the divine smite feature blows other character options out of the water in the early levels. The paladin gets the opportunity to soak in tons of hits, make extra attacks, and add bonus damage dice on to those attacks. Compared to rogues, fighters, barbarians and rangers, paladins bring a little too much power to the table and don't give the other characters enough time in the spotlight. 

If you are finding paladins to be consistetly outshining other characters at your table, consider one of these changes to Divine Smite to open up other ways to play the class and real in the sheer number of times your paladin will do something amazing and epic.
