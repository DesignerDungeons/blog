## Hotfix: Divine Smite

By dim torchlight, Clarence leads his allies through the dank and decrepid mosoleum entrance. The light illuminates a lone the backs of a group of patroling zombies, each losing bits of themselves as they shamble. The light catches their attention- their heads swivle towards the paladin and his comrads. Torch in one hand and blade in the other, blinding light erupts as Clarence drives his blade clean through the first undead monster. The others reach out begin the all so familiar zombification process, but not in time. With a clean swipe and a blast of radiance, the zombies are cleaved in half by rightous flames leaving their lifeless singed corpses before him.

A dwarf dawned in his own masterwork armor hides behind an iron statue of his ancestors- the monstrous demon thrashes about in the lava pools of their forge. He readies his axe, turns the corner with a dwarfish battlecry, charges and leaps at the twelve foot tall devil. Radiant flames lick the edge of his blade as it sinks into the chest of the Pit Fiend, leading to it falling backwards and unleashing a pained, terrifying roar. 

A halfling riding a mastiff garbed in light chain and a leaf crown trots through the forest. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices a flicker of pink light and whispy giggles. Careful to track the light, she jovially works his way over to the pond. Just as the fey trickster moves in from behind to strangle and devour this tastey treat, her divine sense alerts her to this deception. She turns and sinks her short halfling blade coated in poison into the invisible faeries chest. "Not today, fey friend! These woods belong to the Barleybeards!" 


Today on Hotfix, we are looking at an iconic Paladin ability: Divine Smite. 

> #### Divine Smite (PHB 85)
>
>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

Divine Smite is a feature that causes quite a bit of trouble for some tables. The paladin class gets the opportunity to soak in tons of hits, make extra attacks, and add bonus damage dice on to those attacks. Compared to rogues, fighters, barbarians and rangers, paladins can bring a little too much power to the table and don't give the other characters enough time in the spotlight. We want to give a variety of paladins room to shine and breathe some more diversity into the classes core play pattern. The Divine Smite feature is one of the main culprates to all of these issues- it gives paladins a tool to deal massive damage along side their iconic defenses and healing power that outshines their other existing features.

### When You'd Want to Change Divine Smite
1. Paladins at your table have felt copy and pasted- not enough variety in the class 
2. Paladins frequently and consistently are out performing other classes. They are "hogging the spotlight".
3. A player wants to build around a particular fantasy, but the Divine Smite pushes them into the classic paladin look

To address these core three issues, here are three variations of the feature that address parts of or all of the issues players and DMs might run into at the table. 

> #### Encounters Per Day
>
> Divine Smite is a feature that's power is closely tied to the number of encounters the party has in a day. Groups that have 1-2 large encounters a day will tend to find the feature far more powerful than groups expected to go through 3-8 small/medium encounters per long rest. 
>
> Paladins who are already conserving spells for healing as they are expected to go 6+ encounters before a rest need different attention than those going for an encounter or two before resting. Each has a separate expierence with the feature- one finds it entirely useless while the other is nuking enemies left and right. 
>
> Knowing which kind of group you tend to play with can help determine which fix is best for your table. Consider that fix three likely works great at both, while fix 1 and 2 work better with small numbers of encounters per long rest.

### Quick Fixes

#### Option 1: Nerf Bat
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

This fix is the ugliest, but the simplist. It makes the spell versions substantially better comparitively, as even now Searing Smite has the potential to do more damage more consistently. It still has many of the problems the old smite had, but does slightly incentivize using spells to do other things. 

It helps address paladins who are consistently out performing other classes, but not in a way players can be excited about. This fix can work in a sense, but lets see what more we can adjust to fix more of the options issues.


#### Option 2: Adjusted Action Economy
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, you can channel holy enegry into your weapons to smite your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume a spell slot to imbue radiant damage into a melee weapon. The next time on your turn you hit a creature with the imbued melee weapon you deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 4d8. The damage increases by 2d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

This option is brings Divine Smite into the realm of "fair" mechanics. There is now a risk- if you miss, your spell slot did nothing. Notably, this reduces the number of times a character both crits and smites. Having to decide before the roll removes a players ability to decide to smite because they crit. While this does substantially reduce the power, it does make moments where you *do* crit on a smite feel amazing. 

On top of that, this option shifts some of the damage to make smiting substantially more effective against fiends and undead while just okay against other creatures. This incentivizes players to load of damaging spells (like the spell smites) on regular creatures, and when they run into a fiend or undead you better believe they are excited to pull out their classic divine smite.

Here we have moved towards giving paladins a variety of play patterns. Players have to actively decide between smiting or using other spells more consistently. *Divine favor* seems better when it takes the same action your smite does and will do something long term, even if you miss your initial attack. Vengence paladins can consider *hunter's mark* instead, not along side, smite. This moderately improves the fantasy element as well by encouraging more diviersity of abilities and mainly smiting when you are fighting specifically undead or demons. We can do better, though. We can really satisfy player fantasy in a big way.

#### Option 3: Custom Smiting
> #### Divine Smite 
>
> Starting at 2nd level, choose two of the following creature types: fey, fiend, undead, elemental, abberation, monstrosity, ooze, or celestial. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant. 
>
> Whenever you a hit a creature of the one of the chosen types, you can choose to deal 2d10 damage of the chosen type to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. This damage improves to 3d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 9th level, 5d10 at 13th level, and 6d10 at 17th level. 
>
> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all uses of this feature when you complete a short rest.

This itteration introduces an entirely new resource to paladins that only affects a chosen pairing of enemies. This opens up players to specialize exactly how they want and be at their best when fighting monsters their character most opposes. Evil paladins can smite from the 9 hells against fey and celestials while a devotion pure good paladin can still radiantly smite undead and fiends (now better than before!). It forces paladins to construct a meaningful spell list while moving their moments of awesomeness to specific encounters they are expected to be amazing in. 

This change will most directly impact the table. It clearly defines when your paladins should smite and feel awesome. The player gets to pick that moment, making it way more meaningful and helping players own their character they built. On top of this, paladins will start to feel and appear diverse within their own Oaths- a Vengence paladin that hunts undead looks way different now than an evil Vengence paladin hunting Angels. Ones smite is radiant and slays undead and demons while the other targets angels and other outsiders with necrotic or fire damage. 

These smites all look unique- they have their own flavor built right in. They dramatically reduce a paladin's ubiquetous power while still providing a fair chunk of encounters where the paladin can feel awesome. 

 
 ### Crowding Out Other Features

Divine Smite breaks one of the fundamental rules of combat: actions. It takes no additional action to use. This leaves paladins free to choose when to nuke a monster with a resource they don't have to ever use. This mechanic then discourages paladins from using spells in other ways as that costs them something- a simple comparison to *searing smite* shows you the radically difference in power the two features have. 

If, in a given encounter, a player is expected to make a certain number of attacks, players can numerically decide when it is worth it and when it isn't worth it to risk resources. Spells like *divine favor* present a potential d4 extra damage per attack at the cost of a bonus aciton on your turn. With an average extra 2.5 radiant damage per hit, you nead to hit with 4 attacks to barely break divine smite's average of 9 damage. The damage from *divine smite* also happens now- front-loading damage tends to be out perform damage over time in 5th eddition by the nature of shorter (1-3) round encounters. 

> #### The Other Smites
>
>The comparable level 1 smite spells (*thunderous, searing, wrathful*) all also have an extra condition associated with the resource use- you have to use the resource before you know if you will hit a creature that turn. If you *wrathful smite*, miss, and the encounter ends before your next turn, you've effectively just lost a spell slot for no reason. You likely weren't going to match *divine smite*'s damage for a small upside of potentially frightening the creature. This matters. Wasting resources feels bad. Whenever there is an impactful and epic moment in the encounter- the deciding final blows- missing an attack and wasting a spell slot can mean future disaster.  

The majority of spells provide far more risk for about equal or less reward. The scaling of divine smite turns your level 1 spells into a long chain of smites on nearly every attack in the mid-upper levels with a smaller number of encounters per day. 

Having a powerful feature only is an issue when it crowds out other cool and interactive features. Divine Smite tends to be that powerful of a feature compared to what other features paladin has access to.

Option 1 fixes this issue the most directly- by reducing the base damage, Paladins are now encouraged to prepare combat spells to use to improve their smiting potential instead of finding the rare situation where they are more effeicient than regular smites. 


### Outshining Other Options
Similarly to how Divine Smite crowds out other paladin features, it helps the paladin class outshine the other martial classes in combat consisently. Paladins have access to healing, heavy armor, martial weapons, spell casting, and a resource that boosts their damage on hit. Fighters lack healing, spell casting, and the damage boost at 2nd level- rogues don't have the proficiency, healing, heavy armor, spell casting, or martial weapons. Ranger's are slightly closer to paladins in the scope of things they can do, but their features like *hunter's mark* and *cure wounds* tend to be outshone by paladin's other features when you compare them to natural explorer. 

When in combat, a paladin consistently has moments to smite and look awesome on top of the moments they can feel awesome when they take a huge blow from a baddy that would have dropped their lower AC and HP companions. They can shine when they bring back up their downed cleric while turning the following round and nuking the big bad for a huge portion of their HP. Whenever they roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, they get to feel the most awesome by dumping their highest level spell slot and watching their target explode.

Out of combat, their spell list and class features support utility like *detect poison and disease*, *command*, and divine sense. Paladins just have such a huge toolbox to be useful and feel needed. It can make other players feel like they aren't needed. Charisma encouraged characters makes them excellent party faces in addition to all of this- so your bard can stand back while the paladin takes center stage (literally).

I find consistently that the Paladin class just has slightly too many things going for it that cause my players to go "wow, that paladin just does everything..." This is an issue we can address by shifting more power into specific environments for the paladin to shine. Option 2 does this by adding risk to Divine Smite (if you miss, you wasted the resource) and prevents the smite-critting form occuring as often. Option 3 looks to shift their focus entirely to be epic against their chosen enemies with their smite while using other parts of their kit to have awesome moments in encounters that don't include their selected enemies. 

### Deliver Specific Fantasy
My final large problem with Divine Smite stems from its linear fantasy fulfillment. 

Paladins shifted away from their roots in this eddition. Paladins are now the class the follows a code and draws power from it- their Oath defines them. Paladins can be protecters of life (Devotion), guardians of nature (Ancients), or even vengful hunters (Vengence). All three options smiting undead and demons with radiant damage feels off. Sure, a devotion paladin might be set on purging that evil from the world. But a vengence paladin seems more like a character type that would be willing to pay a price to see pain and suffering fall on their enemies. They might consider fiends and undeads more allies than enemies.

Smite being forced to be good against specific creatures and use radiant damage locks a fantasy into the paladin class (as does Lay on Hands similarly). 

The damage boost doesn't even really feel that much more epic when you do hit an undead or fiend- one bonus die when you normally do twice that is just gravy. You aren't expert against undead or fiends, you just happen to hit slightly harder against them. 

My goal here then is to present players with a way to fit their smite to their character. Players should feel like their character smites just the way they want. Option 3 delivers here like none of the other options do in a big way. 

### Closing Thoughts 
What is noticably absent here that is normally a part of my Hotfixes is a way for the feature to interact better with thier allies. Paladins as a class already have a great interactive toolbox for interacting with their party with Lay on Hands, *sanctuary*, *divine sense*, and the protection fighting style. That doesn't mean smite can't involve more teamwork, but I don't feel it really needs to here.

None of these three fixes are perfect, but they can be fun and helpful replacements at the right tables. If you are looking to play as or with a paladin, I'd talk some of these changes with them. Changing a class feature like this can help redefine the class.
