## Hotfix: Divine Smite

When playing the Paladin class, the question frequently comes up- do I smite? 

Useful tip for new players: yes. Yes you smite.

Divine Smite is a class feature that turns spellcasting into raw damage. Paladins more than any martial class have access to the largest toolbox and smite tends to push their damage to the top of the charts.

>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

In my personal expierences with how I run larger encounters, but fewer per long rest, I find the divine smite feature blows other character options out of the water in the early levels. The paladin gets the opportunity to soak in tons of hits, make extra attacks, and add bonus damage dice on to those attacks. Compared to rogues, fighters, barbarians and rangers, paladins bring a little too much power to the table and don't give the other characters enough time in the spotlight. 

### Reasons to Fix
These are my three biggest reasons to hotfix Divine smite: 

1. It crowds out other paladin abilities from being used 
2. It allows Paladins to "shine" too frequently
3. It doesn't convey fantasy well

#### Option 2: Adjusted Action Economy
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, you can channel holy enegry into your weapons to smite your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume a spell slot to imbue radiant damage into a melee weapon. The next time on your turn you hit a creature with the imbued melee weapon you deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.


#### Option 3: Custom Smiting
> #### Divine Smite 
>
> Starting at 2nd level, choose two of the following creature types: fey, fiend, undead, elemental, abberation, monstrosity, ooze. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant. 
>
> Whenever you a hit a creature of the one of the chosen types, you can choose to deal 2d10 damage of the chosen type to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. This damage improves to 3d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 9th level, 5d10 at 13th level, and 6d10 at 17th level.

> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all uses of this feature when you complete a short or long rest.

Divine Smite breaks one of the fundamental rules of combat: actions. It takes no additional action to use. This leaves paladins free to choose when to nuke a monster with a resource they don't have to ever use. This mechanic then discourages paladins from using spells in other ways as that costs them something- a simple comparison to *searing smite* shows you the radically difference in power the two features have.
