## Hotfix: Divine Smite

When playing the Paladin class, the question frequently comes up- do I smite? 

Useful tip for new players: yes. Yes you smite.

Divine Smite is a class feature that turns spellcasting into raw damage. Paladins more than any martial class have access to the largest toolbox and smite tends to push their damage to the top of the charts. 

> #### Divine Smite (PHB 85)
>
>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

In my personal expierences with how I run larger encounters, but fewer per long rest, I find the divine smite feature blows other character options out of the water in the early levels. The paladin gets the opportunity to soak in tons of hits, make extra attacks, and add bonus damage dice on to those attacks. Compared to rogues, fighters, barbarians and rangers, paladins bring a little too much power to the table and don't give the other characters enough time in the spotlight. 

### Reasons to Fix
These are my three biggest reasons to hotfix Divine smite: 

1. It crowds out other paladin abilities from being used 
2. It allows Paladins to "shine" too frequently
3. It doesn't convey fantasy well

### Quick Fixes

> Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage.

This fix is the ugliest, but the simplist. It makes the spell versions substantially better comparitively, as even now Searing Smite has the potential to do more damage more consistently. It still has many of the problems the old smite had, but does slightly incentivize using spells to do other things. 

#### Option 2: Adjusted Action Economy
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, you can channel holy enegry into your weapons to smite your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume a spell slot to imbue radiant damage into a melee weapon. The next time on your turn you hit a creature with the imbued melee weapon you deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 4d8. The damage increases by 2d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

This option is brings Divine Smite into the realm of "fair" mechanics. There is now a risk- if you miss, your spell slot did nothing. Notably, this reduces the number of times a character both crits and smites. Having to decide before the roll removes a players ability to decide to smite because they crit. While this does substantially reduce the power, it does make moments where you *do* crit on a smite feel amazing. 

On top of that, this option shifts some of the damage to make smiting substantially more effective against fiends and undead while just okay against other creatures. This incentivizes players to load of damaging spells (like the spell smites) on regular creatures, and when they run into a fiend or undead you better believe they are excited to pull out their classic divine smite. 

#### Option 3: Custom Smiting
> #### Divine Smite 
>
> Starting at 2nd level, choose two of the following creature types: fey, fiend, undead, elemental, abberation, monstrosity, ooze, or celestial. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant. 
>
> Whenever you a hit a creature of the one of the chosen types, you can choose to deal 2d10 damage of the chosen type to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. This damage improves to 3d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 9th level, 5d10 at 13th level, and 6d10 at 17th level. 
>
> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.

This itteration introduces an entirely new resource to paladins that only affects a chosen pairing of enemies. This opens up players to specialize exactly how they want and be at their best when fighting monsters their character most opposes. Evil paladins can smite from the 9 hells against fey and celestials while a devotion pure good paladin can still radiantly smite undead and fiends (now better than before!). It forces paladins to construct a meaningful spell list while moving their moments of awesomeness to specific encounters they are expected to be amazing in. 

## Feature Breakdown 

So why exactly should we change Divine Smite? How does it crowd out paladin features, outshine other character classes and fail to deliever on specific character fantasy?

> #### When to Hotfix Divine Smite
>
> Divine Smite is a feature that's power is closely tied to the number of encounters the party has in a day. Groups that have 1-2 large encounters a day will tend to find the feature far more powerful than groups expected to go through 3-8 small/medium encounters per long rest. 
>
> My experience is reflected when a Paladin can Divine Smite on a 20-25%+ of their attacks per long rest. If your encounters are long or numerous enough where a paladin can only realistically smite less than that, these fixes can still potentially improve your expierence, but likely less so. 



Combined with the feature dealing fair amounts of damage for spell usage, paladins have the ability to dump 3-4d8+  strength every turn on their enemies per attack. Compared to a rogues conditional once a round 2-3d6+ dex damage, we can clearly see a paladin is going to frequently be outdamaging other members of the party.
 
 ### Crowding Out Other Features

Divine Smite breaks one of the fundamental rules of combat: actions. It takes no additional action to use. This leaves paladins free to choose when to nuke a monster with a resource they don't have to ever use. This mechanic then discourages paladins from using spells in other ways as that costs them something- a simple comparison to *searing smite* shows you the radically difference in power the two features have. 

If, in a given encounter, a player is expected to make a certain number of attacks, players can numerically decide when it is worth it and when it isn't worth it to risk resources. Spells like *divine favor* present a potential d4 extra damage per attack at the cost of a bonus aciton on your turn. With an average extra 2.5 radiant damage per hit, you nead to hit with 4 attacks to barely break divine smite's average of 9 damage. The damage from *divine smite* also happens now- front-loading damage tends to be out perform damage over time in 5th eddition by the nature of shorter (1-3) round encounters. 

The comparable level 1 smite spells (*thunderous, searing, wrathful*) all also have an extra condition associated with the resource use- you have to use the resource before you know if you will hit a creature that turn. If you *wrathful smite*, miss, and the encounter ends before your next turn, you've effectively just lost a spell slot for no reason for a chance to not even match the damage of your *divine smite* with a small upside of potentially frightening the creature. 

The majority of spells provide far more risk for about equal or less reward- the scaling nature keeps turning your level 1 spells into a long chain of smites on nearly every attack in the mid-upper levels. 

Having a powerful feature only is an issue when it crowds out other cool and interactive features. Divine Smite tends to be that powerful of a feature compared to what other features paladin has access to.

Option 1 fixes this issue the most directly- by reducing the base damage, Paladins are now encouraged to prepare combat spells to use to improve their smiting potential instead of finding the rare situation where they are more effeicient. 


### Outshining Other Options
Similarly to how Divine Smite crowds out other paladin features, it helps the paladin class outshine the other martial classes in combat consisently. Paladins have access to healing, heavy armor, martial weapons, spell casting, and a resource that boosts their damage on hit. Fighters lack healing, spell casting, and the damage boost at 2nd level- rogues don't have the proficiency, healing, heavy armor, spell casting, or martial weapons. Ranger's are slightly closer to paladins in the scope of things they can do, but their features like *hunter's mark* and *cure wounds* tend to be outshone by paladin's other features. 

When in combat, a paladin consistently has moments to smite and look awesome on top of the moments they can feel awesome when they take a huge blow from a baddy that would have dropped their lower AC and HP companions. They can shine when they bring back up their downed cleric while turning the following round and nuking the big bad for a huge portion of their HP. Whenever they roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, they get to feel the most awesome by dumping their highest level spell slot and watching their target explode.

Out of combat, their spell list and class features support utility like *detect poison and disease*, *command*, and *divine sense*. Paladins just have such a huge toolbox to be useful and feel needed while other members can't always be the center. Charisma encouraged characters makes them excellent party faces in addition to all of this.

I find consistently that the Paladin class just has slightly too many things going for it that consistently cause my players to go "wow, that paladin just does everything..." This is an issue we can address by shifting more power into specific environments for the paladin to shine. Option 2 does this by adding risk to Divine Smite (if you miss, you wasted the resource) and prevents the smite-critting form occuring as often. Option 3 looks to shift their focus entirely to be epic against their chosen enemies with their smite while using other parts of their kit to have awesome moments in encounters that don't include their selected enemies. 

### Deliver Specific Fantasy
My final large problem with Divine Smite stems from its linear fantasy fulfillment. 

Paladins shifted away from their roots in this eddition. Paladins are now the class the follows a code and draws power from it- their Oath defines them. Paladins can be protecters of life (Devotion), guardians of nature (Ancients), or even vengful hunters (Vengence). All three options smiting undead and demons with radiant damage feels off. Sure, a devotion paladin might be set on purging that evil from the world. But a vengence paladin seems more like a character type that would be willing to pay a price to see pain and suffering fall on their enemies. They might consider fiends and undeads more allies than enemies.

Smite being forced to be good against specific creatures and use radiant damage locks a fantasy into the paladin class (as does Lay on Hands similarly). 

The damage boost doesn't even really feel that much more epic when you do hit an undead or fiend- one bonus die when you normally do twice that is just gravy. You aren't expert against undead or fiends, you just happen to hit slightly harder against them. 

My goal here then is to present players with a way to fit their smite to their character. Players should feel like their character smites just the way they want. Option 3 delivers here like none of the other options do in a big way. 

### Closing Thoughts 
What is noticably absent here that is normally a part of my Hotfixes is a way for the feature to interact better with thier allies. Paladins as a class already have a great interactive toolbox for interacting with their party with Lay on Hands, *sanctuary*, *divine sense*, and the protection fighting style. That doesn't mean smite can't involve more teamwork, but I don't feel it really needs to here.

None of these three fixes are perfect, but they can be fun and helpful replacements at the right tables. If you are looking to play as or with a paladin, I'd talk some of these changes with them. Changing a class feature like this can help redefine the class.
