## Be a Better: Beast Master
So you've cracked open the PHB looking for a new subclass to play. Having just watch *How to Train your Dragon* for the 3rd time, you really like the idea of having some kind of companion that journeys around with you and fights along side you.

The ranger subclass Beast Master catches your eye. This lets me play with an animal companion? Sweet!

As you dive into the option, however, it starts to feel clunky. You have to give up your actions in combat just so your compaion can do stuff- but what your companion is doing doesn't seem all that awesome. Outside of combat its like the companions not even there sometimes.

So how do we take the Beast Master archetype and transform it into a powerhouse option? Normally, we'd adress each portion of a feature bit by bit to address certain builds. Here, because of the complexity of the Ranger's Companion feature, we are primarily focusing on what it can do and how to get the most out of it. 


### How the Companion Actually Works
To full understand how to use the option in and out of combat, we need to know exactly what it does. Understanding all of the context around the Ranger's Companion feature greatly improve the power of the option, from knowing what can and can't be a companion to understanding where it is designed to shine.  


> #### Ranger's Companion
> Choose a beast that is no larger than **Medium** and that has a **challenge rating of 1/4 or lower**. Add your **proficiency bonus** to the beast’s **AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in**. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
>
> The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though **it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to**. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to *move (no action required by you).* You can use your *action* to verbally command it to take the **Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help** action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one attack yourself and you can command the beast to take an Attack action.
>
> While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.
>
> Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.


#### Animal Compaion List 
Lets start first by breaking down what can be your companion.

The following table presents a complete list from the SRD of all beasts that are no larger than Medium and have either a CR of 1/8th or 1/4th. This list exlcudes lower CR animals as while they can act as companions, often they will simply function as mechanically weaker versions of the higher CR beasts. 

Included are distinguishing traits that enhance the compaions performance in and out of combat that gives it an edge over other potential companions.

### Categorizing Companions
When selecting a companion, consider their unique strengths. Certain traits tend to have more or less utility in and out of combat than others in certain circumstances. For example, a **boar's** relentless trait can be incredibly powerful when soaking hits in combat. Outside of that, however, relentless doesn't provide much extra utility. 

Combat heavy features like a **panther's** *pounce*, a **giant badger's** *multiattack* or a **giant frog's** *swallow* all shape how your character will act in combat. Some set up future attacks for your team while others can potentially disable enemies on there own. 

Senses and Stealth are another trait to consider when selecting a companion.. If you as a ranger lack perception, having a companion with Keen Senses and a bonus to perception can act similarly to the Expertise trait. Access to blindsight or darkvision if you lack it can be exceptionally useful for scounting and setting defenses. A **giant centipede's** climb speed paired with it's 30 ft. blindsight can make for a perfect detector when setting up camp in a dungeon or in the wilderness. 

### Tiny Companions
One huge perk to having tiny companions is their size. Being able to fit into places otherwise inaccessable can give the ranger a tool on the inside. Haivng a companion that can take commands to check for creatures, retrieve objects, or open a lock from the other side provides a ton of utility to the table many other characters don't have access to this early. 

**Flying snakes** and **stirge** both also make excellent combat companions early. Flying snakes have flyby and a +9 to hit. These buggers can be dishing out 3d4+1 damage per hit. They can act as excellent harrassers so long as you can prevent them from being shot down. Stirge, on the other hand, can stick themselves into people and if not immediatly delt with drain the target over and over again *without taking your action*. Worst case they consume a full action to remove him or attack it- fortunetly, Ranger's Companion bumps their HP up to 12 at level 3 and 4 extra after that every level onward.
