## Be a Better: Beast Master

### Common Companions 

### How the Companion Actually Works

> #### Ranger's Companion
> Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
>
> The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one attack yourself and you can command the beast to take an Attack action.
>
> While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.
>
> Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.


#### Animal Compaion List 

This table presents a complete list from the SRD of all beasts that are no larger than Medium and have either a CR of 1/8th or 1/4th. This list exlcudes lower CR animals as while they can act as companions, often they will simply function as mechanically weaker versions of the higher CR beasts. 

Included are a pair of distinguishing traits that enhance the compaions performance in or out of combat that gives it an edge over other companions.
