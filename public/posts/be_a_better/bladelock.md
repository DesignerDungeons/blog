# Be a Better: Bladelock
A tiefling in a jester costume dances gleefully in an baron's court. Her eyes dart around the cheering crowd of nobles looking for her mark. As she spins and conjures flames to juggle, she finally spots the ambassidor she's been hunting for her patron. She approaches the ambassador with a bouquet of flowers. As he reaches for the roses, a dagger wreathed in flames with a demonic eye in the handle appears from thin air in her off-hand. After a brief gasp, he lies on the ground, bleeding out from his throat. 

One of the most popular ways to play the Warlock class is building around the Pact of the Blade feature. The fantasy is incredible. A character is gifted a weapon from their Otherworldly Patron: a dagger from the nine hells, a rapier from a fey queen, a trident from a kraken god. All of these promise a fantasy that largely leaves players feeling underwhelmed once they begin using it in practice. The feature isn't poor in my opinion. It actually is quite potent in the right context. So today, we're going over how to get the most out of Pact of the Blade! 

## Feature Breakdown: Pact of the Blade 

> ### Pact of the Blade
>You can use your *action* to **create** a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this **melee** weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon **counts as magical** for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
>
>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
>
>You can transform one Magic Weapon into your pact weapon by performing a Special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears **whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter**. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

At its core, pact of the blade is a utility feature, not a combat feature. This largely where I see the most frustration with the feature. Gaining a weapon from your patron implies its power against enemies, but in practice, it just tends to act as an expanded proficiency boost into martial weapons, normally with only a 1-3 point difference in average damage. The feature itself doesn't provide any huge boosts in early combat outside of being magical. This is somewhat useful but ultimately isn't where the bulk of power comes from. 

Where the feature *is* powerful is in how it provides players with a huge toolbox of weapons to call to their side at will. Players don't have a single weapon forged by their patron but instead an armory of weapons ready to be called to their side at will. You have the ability to conjure any melee weapon you wish as an action. This means you are never unarmed, and have no problem hiding your weaponry. 

Additionally, the feature does not specify that the weapon must come from the base weapon table in the equipment section of the book. This opens up your options into exotic territories as well (with DM permission). You are proficent in any weapon you conjure including martial and exotic weapons. 

Below is a list of weapons the increase your ability to influence combat outside of damage from the core  PHB equipment table.

##### Utility Pack Weapons
|Weapon| Damage| Properties|
|:--|:--:|:--|
|Dagger| d4 piercing| Finesse, light, thrown (20/60), **aquatic**|
|Handaxe| d6 slashing| Light, thrown (20/60)|
|Glaive| d10 slashing| Heavy, two-handed, reach| 
|Trident| d6 piercing| Thrown (20/60), versatile (d8), **aqautic**|
|Whip| d4 piercing| Finesse, reach| 
|Lance| d12 piercing| Reach, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made against creatures within 5 feet of you, two-handed (while mounted)|


> ### The Aquatic Weapon Property
>
> A mini hotfix within this Be a Better! Underwater combat is fairly simple in 5e, but still manages to be confusing and challenging to fully understand. In a nut shell, melee weapon attack rolls made under water have disavantage unless they are from a specific list. 
>
> The aquatic weapon property removes the rule text from under water combat and moves it here instead! The following changes occur:
> 
> When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

> This weapon ignores any penalty it would recieve from making weapon attack rolls under water.

> This does cause some thrown weapons, like the handaxe and throwing hammer, to perform slightly worse, but in exchange we simplify rules for underwater adventuring. A worthy sacrifice for simplification. Expect more to come like this in our next series all about refreshing under water adventuring!

### Defensive Features 
#### Supporting Core Patrons 
Fiend and Fey are pretty sweet for blade locks- GOOs main feature doesn't directly support a melee play style, but can be taken to contrast blade. 

Fiend builds typically involve drain tanking- lower AC, focused around Strength or Dex/Cha/Con, but can be Dex based as well if you want a different stat than con.

Fey are almost always looking for dex and con, to navigate and control combat as opposed to soaking blows and slaying monsters.
