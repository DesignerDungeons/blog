# Be a Better: Bladelock
A tiefling in a jester costume dances gleefully in an baron's court. Her eyes dart around the cheering crowd of nobles looking for her mark. As she spins and conjures flames to juggle, she finally spots the ambassidor she's been hunting for her patron. She approaches the ambassador with a bouquet of flowers. As he reaches for the roses, a dagger wreathed in flames with a demonic eye in the handle appears from thin air in her off-hand. After a brief gasp, he lies on the ground, bleeding out from his throat. 

One of the most popular ways to play the Warlock class is building around the Pact of the Blade feature. The fantasy is incredible. A character is gifted a terrible weapon from their Otherworldly Patron.

Fey are almost always looking for dex and con, to navigate and control combat as opposed to soaking blows and slaying monsters.
