<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeOzo0Axgj0/TPxd8AHkkYI/AAAAAAAABww/GLj3zu2H_b0/s1600/img-hooded_tentacle.jpg">

A crow caws out in the open over the bleak midwinter evening. A cloaked, shaking figure wanders through the snowfall with his bare, bleeding feet leaving red prints in a trail behind him. He is cloaked in a ruined suit, bits and pieces torn around the wrists and ankles with holes made by weapons carved throughout the rest of it. Behind him, in the distance, smoke rises from his latest crime made in the name of the Faceless One. This man either has gone mad and lost all sense of reality or is the only sane one left that sees the future doom racing towards the realm.

5th eddition brought a fun and surpsing twist with the Warlock class when it released. The class was uniquely different from anything the playtest brought before. What came with it was an area of play popular to many RPGs and stories, but moderately unexplored in Dungeons and Dragons: the Great Old Ones. 

These entities add a new dynamic to 5th eddition. Worlds that have a focus around one of these gods to bring out the feel and immersion Great Old Ones lead many players to think about. From *Call of Cthulu* to N'zoth and C'thun of World of Warcraft, DMs have a huge array of tools to bring a unique feeling to the table when dealing with Old Gods and the madness that is tied so closely to them.

This guide aims at giving DMs and Players new tools for roleplaying in these environments as well as general advice for playing games with a Madness or Old God feel to them. 

## Player Options
Players who set forth into a world where an all powerful entity readies to devour all existance might want tools to match this epic theme. Here we present to main ways to embrace the play style: Madness Domain (a redux of Trickery) and alterante Warlock familiars more fit for an incomprehenislbe elder entity. 

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=138kreWGwguUcveB6jrpmPingq77VsA7m) are the options, presented in a printer friendly PDF form. 

## World Building
Worlds riddled with mad prophets and elder gods playing with mortals for entertainment are also full of adventure. Mad cults worshipping these evil entities spring up and threaten the entire surrounding environment with their horrific rituals and sacrifices. Old, abandoned churches can find new life in the hands of mad clerics and priests, praying to gods of insanity that give brilliance along side it. 

The key idea we are going to be focusing on from here on out is the concept of cosmic horror. These ideas stem from my own understanding of pop culture views of great old ones and the genre surrounding their founding stories. 

> ### The Cosmic Horror Contrast
>
> DnD presents the party as heroic actors taking action and shaping the world around them. These PCs matter. Their decisions shape the world and move action. They might even make powerful entites consider them on the Cosmic level.
>
> Cosmic horror stories tend to focus on human insignificance, and can be a great tool to combat the players at the table. The party stands firm that the races of the realm matter in the cosmic scheme of things while the opposition of elder gods and insanity focus instead around the chaotic nature of the universe and the insignficance the party holds. 
>
> It becomes up to the party to prove the entire genre wrong. They must stand up and *matter*. The world literally revolves around them, and they must prove it against the odds when combating the massive horrors that come with insanity and great old ones working only to prove how little the rest of the multiverse matters.

### Followers
Followers of the Maddness and Old Gods take all form of shapes and sizes but can work great for either. These are the lifeblood of your world. NPCs are your characters as a DM and the best tool you have to shape story telling and party decisions. Detailing your these NPCs is vital for getting the feel Great Old Ones in your game and shaping your table towards your own brand of cosmic horror. 

NPCs dedicated Great Old Ones or mad gods tend to share their patorn's goals or overlook them in exchange for power. 
They speak in mad tongues and sew insanity into the people around them. A small hamlet on the outskirts of town with a dedicated temple to maddness might appear normal on the surface, but small quirks and strange mannerisms with the townsfolk can hint at a sinister underlying plot lying in wait. 

The following few tables can help mix and match basic appearances of a follower of Old Gods with significant features and unique traits to set up some basic appearances you can present to your players.

#### NPC Types 
Once you have your appearances worked out it can be useful to decide on what kind of NPCs fit your maddness clergy. You have a huge array of options avalible with some clever reflavoring, even touching on some weirder creatures like Mind Flayers and Oozes.

There are other ways to make your NPCs feel like they belong to a cosmic horror setting. Odd expressions and reppedtive speach are two examples. Consider detailed descriptions focused around eccentricities and oddities important NPCs have. A insane mayor might be wearing a tower of worn, patched hats. Perceptive party members might even notice that the stitching on the patches draws shapes, and incredibly perceptive party members could identify those shapes as monstrous faces of creatures unknown to the party.

#### Spell Services
NPCs in service to world eating beings might not at first seem like the go to place for players to get some useful spells, but like any clergy in fantasy settings, they can offer their unique list of spells to aid players... **for a price.** 

This price can be a great way to immerse players into the insanity before them as it will involve players in part of the maddness. Below are two tables; one showcases some options for spell services members of maddness domains and warlocks of great old ones might have. The other presents some ideas in place of traditional currency a player might have to pay in place of gold for the varying spell levels avalible.

### Environments 
Like many horror settings, cosmic horror stems from subtle alterations to reality but also extends to incomprehensible visions and locatiosn of pure insanity. Setting up players with vivid descriptions can set expectations for the feel and approach they are looking towards when moving foward. When making settings around Great Old Ones, consider focusing in on pop culture views of the genre like tentacle imagery and unsettling images. 

A focus on cosmic scale can help set the mood in these environments. An environments depcition of stellar maps and astronomical devices can set up the otherwordly appearance that goes along side these monsters. 

#### Environmental Effects 
Much like how powerful monsters shape the environment they live, followers and temples to great old ones can shape the physical landscape. Here is a quick table with some ideas on how a well established cult or monster dedicated to eldritch gods might change the world around them.

#### General Stuctures 
Worlds built around these concepts rarely are freindly. Monsters from outside the bounds of reality don't often give friendly aid. Structures built for these entites can look wildly diverse. Some might be simple churches that have small inconsistancies that reveal a hidden secret happening below the surface, while another might be a massive stone obelisk coated in unknown runes along side images depicting the coming old one and its victory over the plane. 

Because of this huge variety, any structure can easily become dedicated to a Great Old One. The following table will focus on descriptive elements you can incorporate into any old building to make lock in further the importance of a Great Old One in the area.

There are some structures that are unique to madness and great old ones however. These places can act as excellent places of worship for your Old Gods or places that simply deal frequently with warlocks and clerics working in the realm of maddness.

#### Dungeons
Dungeons dedicated to Great Old Ones or other mad entities can look quite different from the typcial dungeon. From sacrifical chambers to otherworldly ritual chambers, the rooms you choose to include in your dungeons around these beings can lead to a stand out dungeon that feels like it belongs in a greater story.

How you frame dungeon exploration also plays a pivotal role. A focus on light, temperature, and atmosphere are pivital when creating an immersive expierence. The walls of these dungeons could be slimy stone or literally feel like the slimy interior of a living being. Perhaps torches barely function and magical light and darkvsion cease functioning entirely. These kinds of challenges are aimed at showing the party how small they are as well as present so much of the dungeon as unknown. This once again will tie into our goal of approaching cosmic horror within D&D. Hazzards and monsters in these dungeons likely want to show players how small they are comapred to the universe, and how insermountably powerful their foes are. 

Below are some ideas for effects that can encompass your dungeons entirely to present new, unique challenges that sets these Great Old One dungeons apart from other dungeons.

#### Closing Thoughts
Cosmic Horror and Great Old Ones can be a great change of pace from a regular D&D game. They can act both as the driving force behind a huge story arch as well as a small side quest to distract players from the standard fantasy world they have been used to exploring.
