# Domains and Dieties: Great Old One and Madness 

## Player Options

### Trickery Domain -> Maddness Domain 

#### New Domain Spells 
In place of Trickery Domain's normal domain spells, you instead have the following domain spells: 

|Cleric Level| Spells
|:--:|:--|
|1st| *dissonant whispers, silent image*|
|3rd| *enthrall, mirror image*|
|5th| *hunger of hadar, major image*|
|7th| *confusion, hallucinatory terrain*|
|9th| *dominate person, modify memory*| 


#### Blessing of the Trickster -> Unsettling Illusions 
Starting at 1st level, your illusions are oddly disturbing as if produced from an otherworldly entity. Whenever a creature makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to attempt to discern one of your illusions for what it is, as a reaction, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. 

On a failed save, the creature becomes disturbed for 1 minute and automatically fails the Intelligence (Investigation) check. A creature disturbed in this fashion is frightened by the illusion. It can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish and can't cast spells that require verbal components. A creature disturbed in this fashion can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

#### Cloak of Shadows -> Disturbing Presence 
Starting at 6th level, enemies that stand near you are disturbed by an otherworldly presence surrounding you. Whenever a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you or an illusion of yourself created by your Invoke Duplicity feature, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes distrubed for 1 minute.  A creature disturbed in this fashion is frightened by you or the illusion. It can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish and can't cast spells that require verbal components. 


A creature disturbed in this fashion can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect early on a success. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. 

### Warlock Pact of the Chain Familiar: Oozlet 

Previously, we showed off a Otherworldly Patron: The Endless Ooze. Great Old One Warlocks and Oozelocks alike might want a familiar a little more... *mutable*. A familiar that really can squeeze into their builds and provide some gelatinous goodness. 

Here we have a look at two classic monsters reimagined into familiars for Warlocks.

#### Alternate Familiars
Whenever choosing a for for your familiar to take with your Pact of the Chain feature, optionally you can take an one of the following Oozlets: 

___
