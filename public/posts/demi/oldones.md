# Domains and Dieties: Great Old One and Madness 
<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeOzo0Axgj0/TPxd8AHkkYI/AAAAAAAABww/GLj3zu2H_b0/s1600/img-hooded_tentacle.jpg">

A crow caws out in the open over the bleak midwinter evening. A cloaked, shaking figure wanders through the snowfall with his bare, bleeding feet leaving red prints in a trail behind him. He is cloaked in a ruined suit, bits and pieces torn around the wrists and ankles with holes made by weapons carved throughout the rest of it. Behind him, in the distance, smoke rises from his latest crime made in the name of the Faceless One. This man either has gone mad and lost all sense of reality or is the only sane one left that sees the future doom racing towards the realm.

5th eddition brought a fun and surpsing twist with the Warlock class when it released. The class was uniquely different from anything the playtest brought before. What came with it was an area of play popular to many RPGs and stories, but moderately unexplored in Dungeons and Dragons: the Great Old Ones. 

These entities add a new dynamic to 5th eddition. Worlds that have a focus around one of these gods to bring out the feel and immersion Great Old Ones lead many players to think about. From *Call of Cthulu* to N'zoth and C'thun of World of Warcraft, DMs have a huge array of tools to bring a unique feeling to the table when dealing with Old Gods and the madness that is tied so closely to them.

This guide aims at giving DMs and Players new tools for roleplaying in these environments as well as general advice for playing games with a Madness or Old God feel to them. 

## Player Options
Players who set forth into a world where an all powerful entity readies to devour all existance might want tools to match this epic theme. Here we present to main ways to embrace the play style: Madness Domain (a redux of Trickery) and alterante Warlock familiars more fit for an incomprehenislbe elder entity. 


### Trickery Domain -> Maddness Domain 
This redux reworks some of Trickery Domains core features while using existing features to lessen the shift the option normally would bring to table. A player looking to play a Maddness cleric could take the normal Trickery Domain and replace its spell list, 1st, and 6th level feature to better embody this concept. 


#### New Domain Spells 
In place of Trickery Domain's normal domain spells, you instead have the following domain spells: 

|Cleric Level| Spells
|:--:|:--|
|1st| *dissonant whispers, silent image*|
|3rd| *enthrall, mirror image*|
|5th| *hunger of hadar, major image*|
|7th| *confusion, hallucinatory terrain*|
|9th| *dominate person, modify memory*| 


#### Blessing of the Trickster -> Unsettling Illusions 
Starting at 1st level, your illusions are oddly disturbing as if produced from an otherworldly entity. Whenever a creature makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to attempt to discern one of your illusions for what it is, as a reaction, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. 

On a failed save, the creature becomes disturbed for 1 minute and automatically fails the Intelligence (Investigation) check. A creature disturbed in this fashion is frightened by the illusion. It can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish and can't cast spells that require verbal components. A creature disturbed in this fashion can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

#### Cloak of Shadows -> Disturbing Presence 
Starting at 6th level, enemies that stand near you are disturbed by an otherworldly presence surrounding you. Whenever a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you or an illusion of yourself created by your Invoke Duplicity feature, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes distrubed for 1 minute.  A creature disturbed in this fashion is frightened by you or the illusion. It can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish and can't cast spells that require verbal components. 

A creature disturbed in this fashion can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect early on a success. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. 

### Warlock Pact of the Chain Familiar: Oozlet 

Previously, we showed off a Otherworldly Patron: The Endless Ooze. Great Old One Warlocks and Oozelocks alike might want a familiar a little more... *mutable*. A familiar that really can squeeze into their builds and provide some gelatinous goodness. 

Here we have a look at two classic monsters reimagined into familiars for Warlocks.

#### Alternate Familiars
Whenever choosing a for for your familiar to take with your Pact of the Chain feature, optionally you can take an one of the following Oozlets: 

___
> ## Gray Oozlet
>*Tiny ooze, unaligned*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 8
> - **Hit Points** 9 (2d4 + 4)
> - **Speed** 10ft., climb 10 ft.

> ***False Appearance.*** While the oozelet remains motionless, it is indistiguisable from an oily pool or wet rock. 
>___
> ### Actions
> ***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 1 (1d4-2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage, and if the target is weaing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
>
> ***Psychic Crush (Reacharge 5-6).*** The ooze targets one creature that it can sense within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

___
> ## Ochre Oozlet
>*Tiny ooze, unaligned*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 8
> - **Hit Points** 9(2d4 + 4)
> - **Speed** 10ft., climb 10 ft. 
>___

>___
> ### Actions
> ***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 1 (1d4-2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage, and if the target is weaing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
>
> ***Split.*** While it is a single oozelet, it can split as an action into two slightly smaller Tiny oozelets. Each new oozlet has hit points equal to half the original oozlets, rounded down. The oozelets reform into a single oozelet after 1 minute spent sharing the same space. 

## World Building
Worlds riddled with mad prophets and elder gods playing with mortals for entertainment are also full of adventure. Mad cults worshipping these evil entities spring up and threaten the entire surrounding environment with their horrific rituals and sacrifices. Old, abandoned churches can find new life in the hands of mad clerics and priests, praying to gods of insanity that give brilliance along side it.
